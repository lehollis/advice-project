<h1>luckily, chicago is a very easy city to navigate around by yourself. public transportation runs all over the city as well as in the suburbs. besides driving, the train is probably the best option because of their reliability and speed. the cta is the most affordable option, however, it's dirtier and less safe compared to the metra. the metra is also faster to take to the suburbs if you take the express train. the only downside is that the metra runs at very specific times whereas the cta runs very frequently. my 15-mile commute took about an hour and fifteen minutes via cta, but on the metra express, it only takes thirty-five minutes. if you live more within the city, the bus is also a good option. the cta and pace buses will most likely take you closer to your desired destination as the stops are very frequent. kode with klossy also provides a travel stipend, giving a scholar either a ventra card or a gas card. although driving seems like it would be convenient, it's probably the least convenient because of the unpredictable traffic, especially during rush hour. whatever you decide, make sure you know what you're doing - safety is always the most important, especially in a big city like chicago.</h1>
