 <h1>I had previously had experience coding with a program called Girls Who Code, and the Technovation Challenge.  I went into Kode with Klossy level 1 because I didn't yet feel as comfortable with my abilities coding as I wanted to be.  I saw that in level 1 the students worked on Ruby, and I had always wanted to do that.  Just within the first day, I was learning SO much! By the end of week one, I was amazed by how much I had learned in such a short amount of time.  It really helped coming in everyday, because I didn't forget anything.  We got to review things from the day before in the morning, have a lesson and take notes later, and then go more in depth with the curriculum through labs in the afternoon.  I got to improve my communication skills by working with partners and groups too.  I am so thankful for Kode with Klossy and all the skills and knowledge it gave me.</h1>
